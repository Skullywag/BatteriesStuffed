Changes vanilla batteries so that they can be made with stuff, usuall resulting in a variable of different battery efficiencies and such. Also adds batteries of different sizes.

-----

Small batteries are 1x1 cell in size, and have 45% the capacity of the medium battery.
Medium batteries are 1x2 cells in size.
Large batteries are 2x3 cells in size, and have 10% more capacity than 3 medium batteries of that type.

-----

Steel batteries function exactly like base game batteries, they explode in rain, have 50% efficiency.
Silver batteries have an efficiency of 65%, and have 25% more capacity.
Uranium batteries have an efficiency of 80%, are waterproof, do not explode when damaged, and have 50% more capacity.
Plasteel batteries have an efficiency of 90%, are waterproof, immune to circuit overload, do not explode when damaged, and have 35% more capacity.
Gold batteries have an efficiency of 100%, and have 75% more capacity.</description>
