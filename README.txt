Rimworld Batteries, Different materials, efficiencies, sizes.

This mod put simply adds batteries made of different metals, with different efficencies and stats based on the metal type it is made of.  Original mod was made by Skullywag, the new large batteries were added by me along with some balancing updates.

-----

Small batteries are 1x1 cell in size, and have 45% the capacity of the medium battery.
Medium batteries are 1x2 cells in size.
Large batteries are 2x3 cells in size, and have 10% more capacity than 3 medium batteries of that type.

-----

Steel batteries function exactly like base game batteries, they explode in rain, have 50% efficiency.
Silver batteries have an efficiency of 65%, and have 25% more capacity.
Uranium batteries have an efficiency of 80%, are waterproof, do not explode when damaged, and have 50% more capacity.
Plasteel batteries have an efficiency of 90%, are waterproof, immune to circuit overload, do not explode when damaged, and have 35% more capacity.
Gold batteries have an efficiency of 100%, and have 75% more capacity.

So, building your batteries, you must decide if you want high capacity, high efficiency, or immunity to rain or damage explosions.

Each battery also has a slot pending for me to edit their drain rates, but that appears to be a bitch to change so I can't change that right now.

Also please note, the immunity to circuit overload does not function yet. It is intended to function but, it didn't. Will have to try and fix that later.
